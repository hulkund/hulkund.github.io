## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="prof.jpg">

I'm a MEng student at MIT in the [HealthyML Lab](https://healthyml.org). I work on creating trustworthy machine learning models that are robust to distribution shift.

I went to MIT for undergrad and double majored in computer science and mathematics with a concentration in Ancient and Medieval Studies. I've previously interned at Microsoft Research (x2) and Apple Research.

## Research Interest

I'm interested in building theoretically-motivated machine learning systems robust to real world distribution shifts. My other interests include interpretability, optimal transport, foundations of ML, and ML applications in healthcare domains.
