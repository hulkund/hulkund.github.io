## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="prof_utah_2.png">

I'm a first-year PhD student at MIT CSAIL, advised by Prof. Sara Beery! I am grateful to be supported by the MIT Jameel Clinic Fellowship and the NSF GRFP.

Previously, I was a master's student at MIT CSAIL in the [HealthyML Lab](https://healthyml.org) advised by Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi, where I worked on detecting & mitigating distribution shift. Last summer, I was a visiting student at ETH Zurich advised by Prof. Fanny Yang, where I worked on optimal transport and differential privacy. I also attended MIT for undergrad and double majored in computer science and mathematics (Course 6 & 18) with a concentration in Ancient and Medieval Studies. I've had the pleasure to intern at Microsoft Research (x3) and Apple Research. 

I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NHulkund) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MzRVTNoAAAAJ&hl=en). Feel free to contact me at **nhulkund@mit.edu**! 

## Research Interests

I'm interested in building reliable machine learning systems, balancing tradeoffs of performance, efficiency, privacy, and robustness. Some current questions I am thinking about:
- How do we leverage knowledge from large-scale foundation models to be applied for specialized downstream tasks?
- How do we select data for large models carefully for increased robustness and resource efficiency?
- Detecting distribution shifts is well studied on datasets such as ImageNet, how well does this translate to other domains?

In my free time, I enjoy spending my time outdoors 
hiking/biking/sailing/kayaking in the Pacific Northwest and (most 
recently) Switzerland.
